       <p> When Catherine failed to provide Henry with his much-coveted male heir, the king began to consider alternate options.
        Could he annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and marry again?</p>
       <p> When Henry asked Pope Clement VII to declare his marriage illegitimate, the pope refused. Deeply unsatisfied with this
        outcome, Henry and his advisors split the church away from Rome – a process completed in 1534 – resulting in Henry
        becoming head of the Church of England. Feeling he had no need to defer to the pope, he had already married Anne Boleyn
        by this point in order to legitimise her pregnancy.</p>

       <p> On 23 May 1533 – five months after Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn – the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer,
        annulled the king’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon.</p>

        <p>Following the annulment, Catherine took a step back from public life. She was not allowed to see her daughter, Mary, and
        lived in less comfortable circumstances than she would have been used to as queen, moving between remote country houses.
        Catherine died at Kimbolton Castle in January 1536 and her tomb is situated in Peterborough Cathedral. On the day of
        Catherine’s funeral, Henry’s new Queen Anne Boleyn miscarried a baby boy.</p>
